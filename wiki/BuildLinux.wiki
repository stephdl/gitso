We currently support building Gitso on Ubuntu, Fedora and OpenSUSE. 

  # From within the src directory:
  # Update hosts.txt to have preset options for the client. Hosts are comma separated and optional.
  # Run:./makegitso.sh {{{[}}}--source, --opensuse, --fedora{{{]}}}

===Fedora===
  * You will first need to install the following:
    * yum install subversion
    * yum install rpmdevtools

===Notes===
   * We also have the scripts working on CentOS, but CentOS 5.2 doesn't include wxWidgets. If you know differently, please let me know.
   * Currently the stand-alone version is automatically made if you're on Ubuntu, that will probably change at some point. There's no technical reason why it couldn't be done from the other POSIX systems...
